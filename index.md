<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
The revolutionary crossroads between artificial intelligence (AI) and biology is truly one of the most exciting frontiers of our time. In this workshop, we'll delve deep into the reasons why generative AI holds paramount significance in the field of biology.


<br><br>
Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a powerful tool in recent years, opening up possibilities that we could hardly dream of in the past. One such promising AI avenue is Generative AI. Generative models learn and understand the underlying data distribution so well that they can create new data instances that resemble your training data - think of it as producing new knowledge from existing one. In the realm of biology, this ability to generate new, relevant data holds great promise. It heralds a shift in the traditional, reactive model of biological discovery to a proactive, predictive one, enabling us to tackle complex biological questions more efficiently and effectively.
<br><br>	
One particular application of Generative AI in biology that warrants a special mention is drug discovery. The traditional drug discovery process is both time-consuming and expensive, often taking years and millions of dollars to bring a single drug to market. Generative AI can drastically expedite this process by virtually synthesizing millions of potential compounds and screening them for their drug-like properties. It can create novel molecules that could potentially act as drugs, dramatically cutting down both time and cost.
Moreover, generative AI models can predict the interaction of these generated molecules with biological systems, paving the way for personalized medicine. By generating unique genomic and proteomic profiles, these models can suggest personalized therapeutic approaches, revolutionizing the way we approach healthcare.
<br><br>
We look forward to your participation in this exciting discourse on the future of biology and AI.

<h2 class="blackpar_title">Submission Instructions</h2>
<p>
You are invited to submit your papers in our CMT submission <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/genbio2023">portal</a>. All the submitted papers have to be anonymous for double-blind review. We expect each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. The content of the paper (excluding the references and supplementary materials) should not be longer than 4 pages, strictly following the NeurIPS template style (which can be found <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">here</a>). 
<br /><br />
Authors can submit up to 100 MB of supplementary materials separately. Authors are highly encouraged to submit their codes for reproducibility purposes. According to the guideline of the NeurIPS workshops, already published papers are not encouraged for submission, but you are allowed to submit your ArXiv papers or the ones which are under submission. Moreover, a work that is presented at the main NeurIPS conference should not appear in a workshop. Please make sure to indicate the complete list of conflict of interests for all the authors of your paper. To encourage higher quality submissions, our sponsors are offering the <b>Best Paper</b> and the <b>Best Poster</b> Award to qualified outstanding original oral and poster presentations (upon nomination of the reviewers). Also, we will give one <b>outstading paper certification</b> for our special track. Bear in mind that our workshop is not archival, but the accepted papers will be hosted on the workshop website.
